Machine learning is an exciting and rapidly evolving field that has many practical applications in areas like computer vision, natural language processing, and predictive analytics.

To get started with machine learning, let's break down the basics and create a lesson plan for self-teaching. Here's a suggested outline:

**Lesson 1: Introduction to Machine Learning**

* What is machine learning?
* Types of machine learning:
	+ Supervised learning
	+ Unsupervised learning
	+ Reinforcement learning
* Basic concepts:
	+ Regression
	+ Classification

**Resources:**

* Online courses:
	+ Andrew Ng's Machine Learning course on Coursera or edX
	+ Stanford University's Machine Learning course on Stanford Online
* Books:
	+ "Machine Learning" by Andrew Ng and Michael I. Jordan
	+ "Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning" by Christopher Bishop

**Homework:**

1. Watch the introductory videos to machine learning courses.
2. Read chapters 1-3 of the recommended books.

**Lesson 2: Supervised Learning**

* Definition and types of supervised learning:
	+ Linear Regression
	+ Logistic Regression
	+ Decision Trees
	+ Support Vector Machines (SVMs)
* Implementation in Python using scikit-learn library

**Resources:**

* Online tutorials:
	+ Scikit-learn's tutorial on supervised learning
	+ Kaggle's tutorials on supervised learning
* Books:
	+ "Python Machine Learning" by Sebastian Raschka

**Homework:**

1. Implement linear regression, logistic regression, and decision trees in Python using scikit-learn.
2. Experiment with different hyperparameters to improve model performance.

How does this outline sound? Would you like me to elaborate on any of the topics or provide additional resources?

Also, what programming language are you comfortable with? We can tailor the lessons to your preferred language (e.g., Python, R, Julia).
